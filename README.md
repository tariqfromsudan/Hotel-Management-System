# Hotel Management System (Java GUI+ JDBC)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Hotel Management System** built with **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI).  
It is designed to efficiently manage hotel operations such as booking, check-in/check-out, room management, and record-keeping. Supports adding, deleting, searching, and sorting guest information. The system emphasizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts including classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## 🚀 Features
- **Booking Management** – Create, update, and cancel room bookings.  
- **Customer Records** – Store and manage customer details.  
- **Room Management** – Track available, occupied, and reserved rooms.  
- **Check-In / Check-Out** – Manage guest flow with time-stamped records.  
- **GUI with Java Swing** – User-friendly design for easy interaction.  
- **File/Data Handling** – Save and retrieve booking and customer data.

## 📦 Requirements
- Java Development Kit (**JDK 11+**)  
- Java Swing (included in standard JDK)  
- IDE recommended: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans

## 📑 Notes
- This project was developed as an academic exercise to demonstrate **Java OOP** and **GUI application design**.  
- Can be extended with **database integration** (e.g., MySQL) for larger-scale hotel systems.  
- Future improvements could include **login/authentication**, **report generation**, and **billing system integration**.
